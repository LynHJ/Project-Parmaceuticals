    Introduction
    
    This is a case regarding ten types of pharmaceuticals which are used as anti-skin-cancer drug regimens.
   
    In this profile,there are four documents.
        Two of datasets:One is the data of mice and another one is the results after mice used these ten drug regimens;
        One of analysis:Narrowing down any bias factors to uncover the effect of Capomulini, versus the other treatment regimens;
        One of report: A summary based on my analysis.
        
    To make sure my analysis is unbiased.I will do some calculations to check the datasets I have received
    1.Remove duplicated data
    2.Based on each pharmaceutical,calculating the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.
    3.All the pharmaceuticals should be used in similar durations.
    4.Check the mice'sex laying out.
    5.Picking up four pharmaceuticals which have lowest results of SEM of the tumor volume, and comparing via box plots.
    6.Checking the relation between tumour size and timeframe on the pharmaceutical which shows the best result.
    7.Calculating the relation between tumour size and body size.
